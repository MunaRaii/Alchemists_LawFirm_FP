                        <h2>Estate Planning</h2>
                        <p>Rio serves as the enthusiastic greeter for the firm, exuding excitement whenever clients arrive.
                             During your visit to the Toronto office, you'll likely be welcomed by Rio's lively presence just beyond
                              the glass doors. Rio has a penchant for patiently waiting outside the boardroom, a dedicated companion to 
                              Ambie as she wraps up her meetings. While Rio brings joy to the office, there's a somber note in the firm's
                               history as Coco, a beloved presence, passed away in 2021. Coco's absence is deeply felt, leaving an indelible mark on both the
                                firm and the clients who were touched by her warmth. The special bond between Rio and Coco was even highlighted in Precedent Magazine, featuring them in an article that showcased the unique relationships between lawyers and their dogs. 
                            The article served as a tribute to Coco's memory and celebrated the enduring companionship that dogs bring to the legal profession.
